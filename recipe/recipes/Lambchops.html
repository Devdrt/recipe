    <h1>Grilled Lambchops</h1>
     <img src="../images/lamb.jpg">
     <p>Spring is definitely the season for grilled lamb chops.  If you’re like many in my family, you have a preconceived notion that lamb has too strong of a flavor.  The real truth is that if most people had a taste of a good, properly cooked lamb chop, they would change their tune.  I was one of those people that swore I wouldn’t like lamb, until I had the most delicious, tender and perfectly seasoned lamb chop.  Since that moment, I’ve been hooked!</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of lambchops</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
       </ul>
       <ol>
         <li>1. Combine the garlic, rosemary, salt, pepper, lemon zest and olive oil in a measuring cup.</li>
         <li>2.Pour the marinade over the lamb chops, making sure to flip them over to cover them completely. Cover and marinate the chops in the fridge for as little as 1 hour, or as long as overnight. </li>
